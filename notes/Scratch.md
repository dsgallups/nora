## Queuing signals
We need to do the frame by frame thing with neurons

- When a neuron attaches to another, is that on a frame?

We need to figure out how to batch processes for the frame to complete in a two-step cycle

- Neurons receive action potentials at beginning of the frame
- Neurons then


## Questions for Dr. Casal

From a pathophysiological standpoint, to what extent are psychiatric disorders predominantly driven by environmental or vascular factors as opposed to intrinsic alterations in neuronal function and neurotransmission?


In pediatric neurodevelopment, are there documented instances in which specific cortical regions-- such as Wernicke's area -- fail to develop appropriately, despite otherwise normal growth and function of other brain areas


Which neural structures and circuits are primarily responsible for detecting errors and facilitating corrective responses in tasks such as playing a wrong musical note, or touching a hot stove?
